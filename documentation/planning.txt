pthreads


does threadManager contain the threads? or does it make them and hold them?

how to make and use threads:

create the threads, give them a function, they run, join the threads, and we're done
so we don't hold threads, we create them as needed

We need a function to create the threads which call the recursive solver
for each thread, create a puzzlesolver instance, and call the thread recursive solver

create 10 threads, automatically split up the grid as needed
run the solver using those threads, tell the thread manager to run the solver using the threads

make the solutions vector static, protect the vector when we're adding stuff using a lock


make a thread manager, gotta update include paths and makefile
