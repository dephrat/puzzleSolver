This project generates an executable 'puzzleSolver'.
When you run puzzleSolver, the program will attempt to fit your specified pieces into a 10x10 grid.
The program will attempt to fit all the pieces in the 'pieces' vector into the grid.
    To specify the pieces, go to main.cpp and change the pieces found inside the 'pieces' vector.
    You can use the same piece multiple times if desired.
