Most recently added: find-all, allows for specifying the number of solutions to search for

Next up: solution-storage, every solution that's found gets added to an instance vector of solutions

Future plans:
add-pthreads, split up the initial grid into sections, have pthreads scan each section, use locks to
    count total number of solutions found across threads, store solutions in each thread's PuzzleSolver
    instance, merge the solutions into a final solutions vector, display the results
    also remove display from recursiveSolver, maybe replace with storeSolutions
pthread-depth,
